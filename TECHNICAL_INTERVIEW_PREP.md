## Phase 1: Core Feature Enhancement & Backend Integration

### 1. Asynchronous Operations and External API Integration

- **Core Concept:**
  - A method for handling time-consuming tasks like network requests or file I/O without blocking the main thread, thus ensuring a smooth user experience.
  - Primarily utilizes JavaScript's `Promise` objects and the `async/await` syntax for cleaner, more readable code.

- **Application in Our Project:**
  - **`useLocation.ts`:** Asynchronously fetches the user's current location using `Location.getCurrentPositionAsync()`.
  - **Google Places API Integration:** Fetches a list of nearby places based on the user's location in real-time.
  - **Supabase API Integration:** Handles user authentication (login, signup) and manages user's favorite places data with the backend.

- **Sample Interview Q&A:**
  - **Q: "Can you walk me through the process of fetching data from an external API and displaying it on the screen?"**
  - **A:** "Certainly. When a component mounts, I use the `useEffect` hook to call an `async` data-fetching function. First, I set a loading state to `true` to show a visual indicator to the user. Then, within a `try...catch` block, I use the `await` keyword to make an asynchronous call to the external API, like the Google Places API. If the request is successful, the `try` block processes the JSON response, updates the component's state with the new data, and sets the loading state to `false`. If any network or API error occurs, the `catch` block handles the error gracefully by displaying a user-friendly message and also sets the loading state to `false` to conclude the process."

- **Technical Rationale:**
  - We chose `async/await` over `Promise.then()` primarily for code readability. It allows us to write asynchronous code that reads like synchronous code, making the logic easier to follow. Furthermore, it enables the use of standard `try...catch` blocks for more intuitive and robust error handling.

### 2. State Management

- **Core Concept:**
  - The mechanism for managing application data and ensuring the UI updates consistently when that data changes.
  - **Local State:** State confined to a single component, managed with `useState`.
  - **Global State:** State that needs to be shared across multiple components, managed with tools like `Context API`, Redux, or Zustand.

- **Application in Our Project:**
  - **`useState`, `useEffect`:** Used for managing local component state, such as text input values or toggle statuses.
  - **Custom Hooks (`useFavorites.ts`, `useLocation.ts`):** Encapsulated state and related logic for specific domains (managing favorites, fetching location). This approach separates business logic from the UI, making components cleaner and promoting reusability.
  - **`Context API` (For Authentication):** The logged-in user's information is a global concern. We use the `Context API` to provide the user object and authentication status to any component in the app without "prop drilling".

- **Sample Interview Q&A:**
  - **Q: "How did you handle state management in your project? I see you used Custom Hooks; what was the reason for that?"**
  - **A:** "Initially, I managed local state within components using `useState`. As the app grew, I identified stateful logic that was reused in multiple places, such as the favorites feature. To keep my code DRY and separate concerns, I extracted this logic into a `useFavorites` Custom Hook. This hook encapsulates the favorites list state and the asynchronous functions to interact with the backend. As a result, my components became much cleaner and focused solely on rendering the UI. For global state, like the authenticated user's information, I utilized the `Context API` to make it accessible throughout the entire application."

### 3. Component Design and Reusability

- **Core Concept:**
  - Adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, where each component is responsible for only one piece of functionality.
  - Using `props` to pass data and functions from parent to child components, enabling flexibility and reusability.

- **Application in Our Project:**
  - **`explore.tsx` Refactor:** We broke down the monolithic `explore.tsx` file, which initially contained all map-related logic, into smaller, single-purpose components like `MapMarker`, `InfoPanel`, `TravelModeToggle`, and `FilterButtons`.
  - **Generic Components:** We created `ThemedText.tsx` and `ThemedView.tsx` as part of our design system. These components ensure a consistent look and feel across the app and are highly reusable.

- **Sample Interview Q&A:**
  - **Q: "Could you share your experience with designing reusable components?"**
  - **A:** "Yes, while developing the main map screen, I refactored a large component into smaller, reusable ones. For instance, I created a `MapMarker` component that accepts location data and a selection state as `props`. This allowed me to reuse the same component to display different types of markers on the map. Similarly, the `InfoPanel` at the bottom of the screen was designed to display details of any place object passed to it via `props`. This component-based architecture significantly improved code readability, maintainability, and made it much easier to add new features."

### 4. Backend Integration and Security (Supabase)

- **Core Concept:**
  - Leveraging a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) to rapidly implement backend features like a database, authentication, and storage without managing server infrastructure.
  - **RLS (Row Level Security):** A powerful database security feature that controls access to specific rows in a table based on the user's identity.

- **Application in Our Project:**
  - **User Authentication:** Implemented email/password and social logins using Supabase Auth.
  - **Database:** Stored user-specific data, such as favorite places, in Supabase's PostgreSQL database.
  - **RLS Policies:** Applied RLS policies to the `favorites` table to ensure that "a user can only view and modify their own favorites." This policy prevents any user from accessing another user's data at the database level.

- **Sample Interview Q&A:**
  - **Q: "How did you build the backend for your project, and what security measures did you implement?"**
  - **A:** "I used Supabase as my backend. Opting for a BaaS allowed me to quickly set up the database, authentication, and APIs, letting me focus more on the frontend development. Security was a top priority. I leveraged Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) feature heavily. For example, I configured a policy on the `favorites` table that restricts data access so users can only interact with rows that match their own user ID. This is far more secure than client-side checks, as it enforces security at the database level, providing a very robust defense."

## Phase 2: AI Feature Integration and Deployment

### 1. AI Voice Assistant Architecture

- **Core Concept:**
  - **STT (Speech-to-Text):** Converting the user's spoken words into text.
  - **NLP (Natural Language Processing):** Understanding the intent and extracting key entities from the text using a Large Language Model (LLM).
  - **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Converting the processed result back into spoken words for the user.
  - **Serverless Functions:** Offloading sensitive and complex logic, like AI model API calls, from the client to a secure backend environment.

- **Application in Our Project:**
  - **Client-Side:** Provides the microphone UI and uses an Expo library to perform Speech-to-Text conversion.
  - **Supabase Edge Function:** The transcribed text is sent to this function. We use an Edge Function for two main reasons: first, to protect our LLM API keys by keeping them off the client, and second, to abstract complex processing logic to the backend. The function calls an LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to perform NLP, extracting user intent (e.g., 'find places') and entities (e.g., 'pizza', '5 miles').
  - **API Orchestration:** The Edge Function then uses the extracted information to call the Google Places API to fetch the actual location data, which is then returned to the client.
  - **Client-Side:** The client displays the results on the map and uses a Text-to-Speech library to announce the findings, such as "I found three pizza places nearby."

- **Sample Interview Q&A:**
  - **Q: "Can you describe the architecture and data flow of the AI voice assistant feature?"**
  - **A:** "When a user speaks into the microphone, the client app transcribes the speech to text. This text is then sent to a Supabase Edge Function. This serverless function acts as a secure orchestrator. It forwards the text to an LLM for natural language processing to understand the user's intent. Based on the intent, the function then calls the Google Places API to fetch relevant data. Finally, the search results are sent back to the client. The client app then both displays the locations on the map and uses Text-to-Speech to read the results back to the user. This architecture ensures that our API keys are secure and separates the heavy processing from the client, keeping the app responsive."

### 2. Deployment and CI/CD (Vercel)

- **Core Concept:**
  - **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** A pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment process whenever new code is pushed to a repository (like GitHub).
  - **Environment Variables:** A method for securely managing sensitive information like API keys and database credentials, keeping them separate from the codebase.

- **Application in Our Project:**
  - **GitHub & Vercel Integration:** We connected our GitHub repository to a Vercel project. This set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys a new version of the application whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch.
  - **Environment Variable Management:** All sensitive keys (Supabase URL, Google Maps API key, LLM API key) were stored securely in Vercel's environment variables. This practice enhances security by ensuring no secrets are ever committed to the code repository.
  - **Expo for Web:** We configured the project to build for the web, allowing us to deploy it on Vercel. This involved addressing web compatibility issues with some React Native libraries, such as `react-native-maps`, by using techniques like dynamic imports or creating web-specific component fallbacks.

- **Sample Interview Q&A:**
  - **Q: "How did you deploy your project, and what was the most critical aspect you focused on during deployment?"**
  - **A:** "I automated the deployment using Vercel. By linking my GitHub repository to Vercel, I established a CI/CD pipeline that deploys the latest version on every push to the `main` branch. The most critical aspect for me was **security and environment management**. I used Vercel's environment variables to manage all sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, ensuring they were never exposed in the codebase. This approach not only secured our secrets but also allowed for flexible configuration between different environments like development and production."
